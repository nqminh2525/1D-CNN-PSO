# 1D-CNN-PSO
Source code implementation for the research project: "CNN Configuration Optimization for IoT Attack Detection Problem"
This project presents an enhanced approach based on the original research by Kilichev et al. (D. Kilichev and W. Kim, "Hyperparameter Optimization for 1D-CNN-Based Network Intrusion Detection Using GA and PSO," Mathematics, vol. 11, no. 17, 2023). Part of the research ideas have been published in: L. T. H. Van, N. Q. Minh, P. V. Huong, and N. H. Minh, "A Novel Approach for 1D-CNN Hyperparameter Optimization in IoT Attack Detection using Particle Swarm Optimization", ISJ, vol. 1, no. 24, pp. 53-71, Jun. 2025.
File Structure
The naming convention for each file is as follows:

0.x (0.0 and 0.1): Original research implementation
1.x (1.0 and 1.1): Enhanced implementation from this project
x.0 (0.0 and 1.0): Code files using fitness function based on original research (single-objective: model accuracy only)
x.1 (0.1 and 1.1): Code files using proposed fitness function (multi-objective: combining model accuracy and execution time)
